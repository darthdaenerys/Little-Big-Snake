# üêç Retro Snake Game

Snake is an artificial intelligence that learns to control a snake. This AI learns to recognize its environment and choose the best direction to survive. Policy gradient and deep Q learning algorithms (implemented with TensorFlow and Keras) are used to train an agent to play the game. The neural network configuration can be saved as a .h5 file.

## What is Deep Q-Learning

Deep Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a deep neural network to approximate the Q-function, which is used to determine the optimal action to take in a given state. For every move, the game will send a reward. If the snake collides with itself or a wall, there is a negative reward. If the snake eats the food, there is a positive reward.

The Q matrix is initially filled with zeros. The size is (number of states, number of actions). Every move that the agent makes, the Q table is updated as below:

    Q[state, action] = reward + gamma * max(Q[new_state, :])

During the training phase, the agent will either choose the action with the max Q value at that state or the agent will randomly choose an action. The Q matrix is then updated using the equation above. This process is repeated until the game is complete. Many games are played to update the Q matrix.

## Getting Started

### Clone

To install, clone this repository to your local machine `git clone https://github.com/darthdaenerys/Little-Big-Snake.git`

Change to clone directory `cd Little-Big-Snake`

Install necessary requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt` or in case you get an error try using `pip install numpy pandas pygame tensorflow matplotlib`

If you ever need to remove a module for any reason, use the command `pip uninstall <module-name>`

### Usage

- Run the `main_self.py` file to control the snake with keyboard.
- Run the `main_ai.py` file to let AI control the snake.

## Instructions

- The snake can move in 4 directions.
- The snake is bounded in all the directions and dies if it goes outside the screen.
- The snake dies if either it collides with the wall or itself.
- The objective for the snake is to eat as many food as possible.
- Feeding the snake increases its length and the score.

### Key Controls

| Action | Primary | Secondary |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Move up| `W` |`up arrow`|
|Move down| `S`|`down arrow`|
|Move left|`A`|`left arrow`|
|Move right|`D`|`right arrow`|
|Pause|`P`| |
|Exit|`Close button`|`Q`|
